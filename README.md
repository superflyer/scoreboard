# Scoreboard

Very simple app to keep track of points.  At the moment data lives in memory (it's lost when you reboot).

Create a scoreboard by putting names in the path separated by hyphens: `http://your-host-name.com:1212/name1-name2-name3`

Scores for a given name are consistent across all paths.
