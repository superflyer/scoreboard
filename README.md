# Scoreboard

Very simple app to keep track of points.  At the moment data lives in memory (it's lost when you reboot) and all you can do is increment.

Create a scoreboard by putting names in the path separated by hyphens: http://<your-host>:1212/name1-name2-name3

Scores for a given name are consistent across all paths.
